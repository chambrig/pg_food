      Our Mission:
    </h2>
    <p>
      We are a group of college students who are seeking to help consumers that know they 
      have weaker stomachs or weak immune systems find food that they can trust won't get an upset stomach or stomache-aches.
    </p>
    <p>
      The goal that we set for this website is to show these consumers the restaurants in the
       Prince George's County area and their current and previous health inspection results. If people are concerned if a restaurant is "clean" 
       they could use our site to check out that specific restaurant to see if there were any past inspections they failed so 
       they can feel confident about eating cleaner.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have constructed this information in a user friendly design that any one can use!
    </p>
    <!--<p>
      We are a team of college students hoping to bridge the gap between consumer knowledge on food
        establishments and those establishments' safety inspections. People usually do not care to look up the food
        safety and hygiene status of a restaurant. We aim to make this health inspection information readily available,
        in a user friendly design, on our website!
