    <p/>Q: How to Use the "Statistics" tab <br>A: On the shaded map of Prince Georges county, there are various different types of inspections that are run in each establishments. There are a total of nine different inspections, with differing results. When a county is lit up, that means that they matched the type of test ran, for example if it is lit for Facility Closed, then the last test of that establishment ended in them closing for a bit or permantly. If not lit then they did not match that test.
